# GRE Word Lists

This project intends to help anyone learn new words by displaying one word at a time 🔠

## Installation 👾

You need `pipenv` to install the dependencies

```bash
pip3 install pipenv
```

Once this is done, run the following

```bash
pipenv shell
```

and

```bash
pipenv install
```

If no errors come up, you are good to go 🎉

## Instructions 📝

Run this command to start the program

```python
python3 words.py
```

The program will wait for some input and proceed to the next word

## Installation

```python
python3 setup.py install
```

If this command is not able to create the required directories, sudo it.

## Contributions

All contributions will be reviewed and added to the repo.

Adding new words to the words.csv file is greatly appreciated 😅
